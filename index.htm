                       Google i/o 2019 started yesterday (7/5/2019) and it’s fair to say there was a mixed
                        bag of announcements throughout the Keynote and going through everything will take
                        a bunch of time. So let’s just have a rapid fire of what went down at Google i/o 2019 
                        opening Keynote.
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Sundar Pichai, CEO, opened with a Google duplex upgrade that books your tickets and fill
                        out your forms on command. From movies, hotels, to car hire, all done by duplex. Go ahead
                        and put your feet up, Duplex’s got this one.
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Google Assistant. In a post Keynote interview, Manuel Bronstein, VP of  product management
                        said- “Imagine that it [Google Assistant] starts understanding you, so fast, so quickly, that
                        speaking to your phone is faster than tapping- or that tapping your phone is gonna feel slow”.
                        They don’t pay around. Oh, did I mention they put their dictation on steroids too? Well, thy did.
                        From the clearest linguist to someone with severe speech impediment- yeah, Google assistant's
                        got you, it understands you, it can help you.
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Products. Nest Hub is now the new name for Google Hub, that also come in a Max version- Hub Max-
                        Creative name, we know. Max has a feature called Google duo which comes with a wide angle lense
                        and subject follow, keeping you front and centre at all times. No more adjusting, super easy
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Pixle 3 has 2 new buddies. Pixle 3A, and Pixle 3A XL. Basically has all the traits of their
                        flagship, but for sub $400- It’s $399. Get this, they put the 3.5mm headphone jack back, take 
                        that Apple!  Comes in 3 colours: Not Black, Clearly White, Purple-Ish. They went to town with 
                        the battery, too, 30hr on a single full charge, 7hr after 15 mins charge. Yeah, I’ll let 
                        you sit down.
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Google Maps. They're going all Ar with this one, no more confusing blue random dot to follow.
                        It’s going to be an IRL directions and arrows  and giant location pins right in front of you 
                        (but still on your phone though, this isn’t 2050)- neat right?
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                        Finally , Ai For Social Good didn’t get as many applause as it diserverd, however it’s such an
                        incredible section of Google. It’s goals include trying to spot cancers before they become 
                        dangerous helping communities and farmers by developing better fooding detectors during seasons 
                        down to exact areas and of course much, much more.
                    </p>
                    <p id="copy">
                      There. You’re all pretty caught up.
